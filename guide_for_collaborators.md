# Priscilla 
the code base uses just the ```Priscilla.c``` and ```Priscilla.h``` file 
all implementations should be small letters all through like ```window_init()``` instead of ```Window_Init()``` or ```WINDOW_INIT()``` as users can code faster that way.

# To-Do List
Below is a list of tasks that need to be implemented for the GUI library.

## Core Features
- [x] Basic window implemetation 
- [ ] Button component with click events
- [ ] Label component for displaying text
- [ ] Text box/Entry component for user input
- [ ] Container component for organizing GUI elements

## Advanced Features
- [ ] Customizable styling for components
- [ ] Support for different font types and sizes
- [ ] Implement mouse hover effects for interactive components
- [ ] Ability to handle keyboard input for focused components

## UI/UX Improvements
- [ ] Responsive layout for different screen sizes
- [ ] Implement basic animations for smoother transitions
- [ ] Support for tooltips for better user guidance
- [ ] Implement a simple event system for inter-component communication

## Documentation and Testing
- [ ] Write documentation for the API usage
- [ ] Implement unit tests for each component
- [ ] Ensure cross-platform compatibility with SDL2

Feel free to contribute to the project. We estimate that the project will be completed by around 600 to 1000 lines of code, as the GUI is minimalistic.
